# Movie Database Web Application

### Overview

The Movie Database Web Application is a Django-based platform designed to manage a collection of movies. It provides functionalities for users to view, add, and rank movies. Additionally, the application implements advanced features such as recommendation algorithms, database optimization, and asynchronous task processing using Celery.

### Features

1. **Movie Management:** Users can perform (Create, Read) operations on movies.
2. **Asynchronous Task Processing:** Celery handles asynchronous task processing for tasks such as movie ranking updates.

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hossainchisty/Movie-REST-API-Django-Ninja.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
4. Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`

### Docker Setup

Alternatively, you can use Docker to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/hossainchisty/Movie-REST-API-Django-Ninja.git>`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Movie-REST-API-Django-Ninja`
3. Build the Docker images: `docker-compose build`
4. Run the Docker containers: `docker-compose up`

### API Endpoints

- **Create Movie:** `POST /api/v1/movies/create_movie`
- **List Movies:** `GET /api/v1/movies/list_movies`

## Questions

1. **How would you design and implement content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms? What databases would you use for efficient storage and querying of user preferences and movie metadata?**

   To design and implement content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, you would typically start by collecting user preferences and movie metadata. Content-based filtering relies on the attributes of the items (movies, in this case) and the user's past interactions to make recommendations. Collaborative filtering, on the other hand, uses the behavior of many users to make recommendations. Both approaches require efficient storage and querying of user preferences and movie metadata.

   For efficient storage and querying, you might use a combination of relational and NoSQL databases. For user preferences and movie metadata, a relational database like PostgreSQL could be used due to its strong support for structured data and complex queries. Additionally, for scalability and flexibility, you might use a NoSQL database like MongoDB or Elasticsearch to store user interactions and unstructured metadata.

2. **How would you optimize database performance for a social networking platform using Postgres, Neo4j, and Qdrant for structured, graph-based, and similarity search data?**

   Optimizing database performance for a social networking platform involves various strategies tailored to the specific database technologies being used. For PostgreSQL, you can optimize performance by indexing frequently queried columns, optimizing SQL queries, and leveraging features like query caching and connection pooling. For Neo4j, performance optimization involves optimizing graph traversals, using indexes effectively, and batching operations. Qdrant, being a similarity search engine, benefits from indexing and vectorization techniques.

   Additionally, for structured data in PostgreSQL, proper database schema design and normalization can improve performance. In Neo4j, ensuring that the graph model is designed to efficiently represent relationships and queries is crucial. For Qdrant, optimizing vector indexing parameters and data preprocessing techniques can enhance search performance.

3. **Describe using Celery for asynchronous task processing in a Django application, ensuring reliability and fault tolerance, especially for tasks that may fail or need to be retried.**

   Celery is a powerful tool for asynchronous task processing in Django applications. To ensure reliability and fault tolerance, especially for tasks that may fail or need to be retried, you can configure Celery with a robust message broker like RabbitMQ or Redis. These message brokers ensure that tasks are reliably queued and processed, even if the worker crashes or restarts.

   Additionally, you can configure Celery to retry failed tasks with exponential backoff, allowing tasks to be retried with increasing delays between retries. Celery also supports task result storage, which enables you to track the status and results of asynchronous tasks, ensuring that no task is lost or forgotten.

   Finally, monitoring and logging are essential for identifying and troubleshooting issues with asynchronous tasks. Celery provides monitoring tools like Flower and integrates with logging frameworks like Django's logging system, enabling you to monitor task execution and diagnose failures effectively.
